# Snard Token White Paper

## 1. Introduction

The **Snard Token (SNARD)** is the native utility token of the Garlip ecosystem, designed to incentivize adoption, reward users, and power future blockchain-enabled applications. Snard will first integrate into **Garlip.com**, a platform for copyright protection and IP authentication, and will later extend to additional applications, creating a multi-app token economy.

With a fixed supply of **1,000,000,000 SNARD**, the token provides scarcity, transparency, and predictable economics to support sustainable growth.

## 2. Supply & Distribution

* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 SNARD (fixed, no inflation)

- Adjusted Distribution Model

* **Community Giveaway (5%)** – **50M SNARD** distributed to Garlip users. Each **£10 subscription** earns **5,000 SNARD**, capped at **50M** in total. This ensures strong early adoption while preserving supply for future apps.
* **Public Sale (35%)** – 350M SNARD offered via token sale events.
* **Team (20%)** – 200M SNARD, vested over 3 years.
* **Reserve (20%)** – 200M SNARD for liquidity, partnerships, and stability.
* **Ecosystem Incentives (12.5%)** – 125M SNARD for creators, developers, validators, and community activities.
* **Marketing & Community (5%)** – 50M SNARD for campaigns and adoption growth.
* **Advisors & Partners (2.5%)** – 25M SNARD under lockup.

## 3. Utility

The Snard Token functions as the backbone of Garlip and future ecosystem applications:

1. **Subscription Incentives** – Rewarding Garlip subscribers with SNARD.
2. **Transaction Medium** – Payment for advanced Garlip features and future app services.
3. **Governance** – Token holders vote on upgrades, burn policies, and ecosystem priorities.
4. **Staking & Rewards** – Planned staking pools for long-term holders.
5. **Cross-App Utility** – Future apps will adopt SNARD as a settlement token, ensuring compounding demand.

## 4. Launch Timeline

* **T-2 Months:** Garlip.com launch.
* **T+0 (2 Months Post-Garlip Launch):** Snard Token launch with limited subscription giveaway.
* **Phase 1:** Community distribution capped at 50M SNARD.
* **Phase 2:** Public Sale (35% allocation).
* **Phase 3:** Exchange listings and liquidity pools.
* **Phase 4 (T+6 Months):** **New application launch**, integrating SNARD as utility token.

## 5. Economic Model

* **Deflationary Design:** Token burns tied to subscription revenue and platform activity.
* **Balanced Adoption:** Reduced giveaway ensures enough supply for the second app ecosystem.
* **Long-Term Incentives:** Vesting schedules align team, advisors, and reserves with multi-year growth.

## 6. Future Ecosystem Expansion

While Snard launches with Garlip, its vision extends beyond a single platform. Six months after launch, **a second app** will integrate Snard, expanding the use cases, creating demand across multiple user bases, and reinforcing Snard’s position as the **ecosystem utility token**.

Each new application will use SNARD for:

* **In-app transactions**
* **Premium service payments**
* **Governance participation**
* **Community rewards**

This ensures that Snard’s utility scales with the ecosystem, not just one platform.

## 7. Roadmap

* **Q1 2026:** Garlip Launch + Snard Airdrop (capped at 50M).
* **Q2 2026:** Public Token Sale, Listings.
* **Q3 2026:** New App Launch with Snard integration.
* **2027:** Governance activation, staking pools, marketplace expansion.
* **Beyond:** Continuous app integrations into the Snard economy.

## 8. Conclusion

Snard Token provides the foundation for a **multi-app blockchain economy** starting with Garlip and expanding into future applications. By scaling back the giveaway, supply remains sustainable for long-term growth while still incentivizing early adopters. Snard is positioned to become a core digital utility across platforms, driving innovation and value in the IP and creator economy.
